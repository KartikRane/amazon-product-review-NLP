## NOTEBOOKS

The notebooks directory is used to maintain the jupyter files which were used during the initial stages of loading and  cleaning the data. 

One can use this as python files as well but jupyter is my personal choice. Its easy to experiment with the dataset. 

There are two main files - 1. load_explore -> To load the dataset from data and understand it structurally 
                         - 2. text_cleaning -> To clean and lemmatize the data
